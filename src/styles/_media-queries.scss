// Media Queries
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

// Note: The best way to structure the use of media queries is to create the queries
// near the relevant code. For example, if you wanted to change the styles for buttons
// on small devices, paste the mobile query code up in the buttons section and style it
// there.

// Larger than mobile
@include break(sm);

// Larger than phablet (also point when grid becomes active)
@include break(md);

// Larger than tablet
@include break(lg);

// Larger than desktop
@include break(xl);

// Larger than Desktop HD
@include break(xx);
